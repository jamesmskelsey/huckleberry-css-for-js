# Huckleberry Agency Website

In this workshop, I built a minimal landing page for an agency.

This mockup is built entirely using _flow layout_: no Flexbox, no grid, no absolute positioning. It relies heavily on padding, margin, and border.

## My Completed Work

I built page that looked like this:

Mobile:

<img alt="Mobile screenshot of agency landing page" src="./docs/huckleberry-james-mobile.png" style="" />

Desktop:
<img alt="desktop screenshot of agency landing page" src="./docs/huckleberry-james-desktop.png" style="" />

## Mockups

We were asked to build this:

<img alt="Desktop-sized screenshot of an agency landing page" src="./docs/huckleberry-desktop.png" style="" />

## Setup Instructions

This project uses Parcel, to provide a development server with lightning-quick hot-reload.

Start by installing dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Boot up a dev server:

```
npm run start
```


You can visit `http://localhost:1234` to view the page. You will see my work on this project.
